        CBT-I focuses on exploring the connection between the way we think, the things we do, and how we sleep. During treatment, a trained CBT-I provider helps to identify thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that are contributing to the symptoms of insomnia. Thoughts and feelings about sleep are examined and tested to see if theyâ€™re accurate, while behaviors are examined to determine if they promote sleep. Sessions may include cognitive, behavioral, and educational components.
