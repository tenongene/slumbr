        One potential barrier to a good nightâ€™s sleep is your sleep environment. Sleep environment refers to your bedroom and other nighttime surroundings. Your sleep environment includes important qualities, like the temperature as well as levels of humidity, light, and noise. Having the right sleep environment can mean the difference between a night of restful, restorative sleep or one filled with uncomfortable tossing and turning.
